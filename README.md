# python-api-challenge

A Python script has been created to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator.  For this task, a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a little common sense has been utilized to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

The first demonstration is a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

After each plot, add a sentence or two explaining what the code is analyzing.
The second requirement is to run linear regression on each relationship. This time, separate the plots into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude):

Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
